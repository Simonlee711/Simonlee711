## My Affiliations and Work
Hello, Iâ€™m @Simonlee711 and I am a current student at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland studying Life Sciences Engineering with a specialization in Biological Data Science. I am a recent graduate at UC Santa Cruz where I obtained my Bachelors of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. 
<br /> <br /> 
Some of my affiliations are @UCLA where I recently completed an internship with the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences. During this 2 month program I worked alongside Dr. Jeffrey Chiang and Akos Rudas where we built a deep learning model that is able to continuously and non-invasively predict blood pressure. The code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Simonlee711/ABP_Imputation-EHR).
<br /> <br /> 
Another one of my affiliations was @UCSC @UCSCGenomicsInstitute in the Jonnson Lab where I worked with Dr. Vanessa Jonnson, Dr. Razvan Marinescu, and Vedu Mallela. Our primary work was in the field of single cell biology where we tried to map gene expression data to the ATAC-seq data for more understanding within a single cell. We experimented with the transformer attention model, a sophisticated deep learning model to perform this task. The code and manuscript can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Simonlee711/Research/tree/master/Transformer/2022)
