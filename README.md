- Hello, I’m @Simonlee711 and I am a current University Student studying Applied Mathematics. I also have knowledge on bioinformatics and computer science and I 
  wish to use all three of these backgrounds to hopefully one day work in bio-technologies. I have familiarity in working with Python, C programming and MIPs 
  Assembly Language. Some of the repositiories below are me showcasing some of my works from classes I've taken at University and some are projects I have simply
  worked on my own. 
- I’m interested in Bio-tech. As previously mentioned being an applied mathematician has been quite the immersive journey through different subjects and what 
  not and being able to have many applications where I can utilize my skills in computation and programming, I hope can one day be of good use to the workforce.
  More specifically I want to improve bio technologies like MRI machines and things used in hospitals to find ways to make them more efficient. Some medical 
  imaging devices require so much precision but I hope to be a member to create something where it doesn't have to be so technical and hope to accomplish that
  with the progression of technologies. The world is so innovative and I hope to be able to be apart of a greater good in my near future.
