- Hello, I’m @Simonlee711 and I am a current University Student studying Applied Mathematics. I also have knowledge on bioinformatics and computer science and I 
  wish to use all three of these backgrounds to hopefully one day work in machine learning with medical applications. I have familiarity in working with Python, C programming, Fortran, Matlab, and MIPS 
  Assembly Language. Some of the repositiories below are me showcasing some of my works from classes I've taken at University and some are projects I have simply
  worked on my own. 
  
- I’m interested in machine learning and finding applications to medicine. During my time at University I have been lucky to spend some time working in Professor Jonsson's lab where I was able to build a deep learning model to predict modalities of a single-cell. Using some form of this background I am curious of using next generation sequencing and making useful models to hopefully see where disease onset occurs. With a new wave of massive genomics data, there is a need for computation to make inferences for these large databases. So through a graduate degree, I hope I can learn about solving some of the mysteries of the world
